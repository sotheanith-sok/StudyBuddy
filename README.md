<!-- Description -->
A platform for students to easily arrange their own study group or discover study groups. This project is built during [BeachHacks] 2019.

## Background
### Inspiration
This project is inspired by our personal experience as we are taking some of the most difficult classes offered at CSULB. Over time, the study group meeting has become a necessity if we wish to do well in class and it is obvious that arranging a study session through group text message is inefficient. As such, we design this application in the hope of solving this problem.

### Challenges
As this is the first time our team ever use Angular framework, it was quite a challenge to get this application to work. Routing management, bootstrap, data binding, dynamic content loading and more are some of the topics that we are struggling to wrap our minds around. Nonetheless, we learn a lot.

### Accomplishments
We're content to be able to produce such a good-looking and dynamic web app in this first iteration.

### Reflections
Web-application concept such as state management, routing, and dynamic content generation. Also, we learned how to use Angular framework.

### Futures
Though we are content with the current iteration of our project, we still have a lot of things that we need to do. The immediate plan is to implement our own backend API server and database. Features wise, we plan to implement a login system, direct chat, events' notification, and so on.
